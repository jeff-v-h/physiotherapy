# physiotherapy
This repository is made to help create a web application for physiotherapists to store patient data.
It aims to not only store their general information, but also what occurred within each consultation session such as subjective, objective and treatments provided.

Currently to view the webpage a Virtual Machine and Vagrant is required. The vagrantfile has been included in the repository.
vagrant is up and running, login to vagrant and change directory to /vagrant. Then use Python to run routing.py.
